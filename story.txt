CHAPTER 1:
The story shall begin on a boat in Mexico.
What is this story about?
Dragons!!!

CHAPTER 2:
The dragon came from the water, all the people on the boat screamed.
The dragon said "don't be scared I'm a harmless dragon".
"I'm only here to eat you all".
The terrified boat goers screams peirce the night.
The dragon was slain and everyone cheered.
Then out of the water came the SUPER MEGA MURDEROUS DRAGON.
This dragon was made to destroy.
Giant robots were created by the national guard to fight the dragon.
Then the dragon farted, laughed and went back into the water.

CHAPTER 3:
Gamera the Giant turtle came to help destroy the the dragon.
Mothra came to fight Gamera.
Godzilla was somewhere.

CHAPTER 8:
The boat later sank, having nothing to do with the dragon or any other monsters.
Everyone died.

FINAL CHAPTER:
Dragons aren't real, stories over - losers...

Posthumous Chapter:
Everyone was dead but the event will be remembered for the ages. Every entinty that
died that day will be remembered by time. Time never forgets, time is always, time is a 
vast expanse of nothingness that we cant control or understand. Everything will always be
at a specific time, the loss of those at this time will exist in the memory of time
where noone can understand what was to be remembered. If this doesn't make sense 
that should be fine, just grab a towel and cry into it.
